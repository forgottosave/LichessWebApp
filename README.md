# Lichess Web App

A simple browser-based [Lichess](https://github.com/lichess-org) App.

I started this project to bridge the gap between the old, depricated Lichess app, [lichobile](https://github.com/lichess-org/lichobile), and the new one, [mobile](https://github.com/lichess-org/mobile). This provides a functional possibility to access Lichess on Android, that is not your daily browser :) 

## Download
All releases can be found [here](https://github.com/forgottosave/LichessWebApp/releases/latest).

Note, that currently there are only pre-releases. They function though, so feel free to use them!

## Special Thanks
to the devs of:
- [lichess](https://github.com/lichess-org), the greatest chess platform
- [sweb](https://github.com/alandau/sweb), the browser this project is based on / forked from
